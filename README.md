Sustainable gardening is eco-friendly and creates a self-sustaining ecosystem. It promotes biodiversity, minimizes waste, ensures long-term environmental well-being, and provides a space for resource conservation. In this era where the climate crisis is a major concern, facility management is a crucial area of focus where we can make significant progress. Integrating sustainable practices through eco-friendly gardening techniques for large facilities will deliver sustainable benefits and cost savings.

1. Choose native plants

Selecting native plants for your gardening can significantly reduce costs. Because these native plants adapt well to the local climate, soil conditions, and insect population, they require less water, fertilizer, and pesticides than non-native plants. There are several things you should know before choosing native plants. Confirm the plant you are choosing is originally from the area. Ensure your site has enough sunlight and moisture for your plant.

2. Water conservation technique

You can use several techniques to reduce water usage in your garden. Water your plants only when they require it. Use water from grey water recycling. Through drip irrigation, you can directly deliver water to the plant’s roots for optimal growth. Use drought-resistant plants to require less watering.

3. Using organic fertilizers and pesticides

Avoid using synthetic chemical fertilizers and choose organic options available for your plants. You can source compost, worm castings, seaweed extract, or manure from local and sustainable sources. These organic alternatives will provide essential nutrients for plants and help improve soil structure and microbial activity. Through this, you are building healthy soil without disturbing its natural system.

4. Sustainable water irrigation

Water is a precious resource, and it’s essential for our longevity. When gardening, we must use water irrigation techniques correctly to prevent water waste. Implementing a sustainable irrigation system through drip irrigation can reduce evaporation. Several advanced devices called smart controllers are available to ensure plants receive the right amount of water.

5. Wildlife-friendly habitats

You can provide nesting opportunities for the creatures. Native plants can attract some native creatures too including birds, butterflies, and so on. This method also helps the plants to bloom properly. They also help to control pests naturally without any cost.

6. Mulching

This technique can make your landscape beautiful as well as play a crucial role in maintaining soil health and moisture. Using shredded bark, straw, or grass clippings, you create a barrier that aids in retaining soil moisture, suppressing weeds, and regulating soil temperature. Then you don’t need to do frequent watering.

7. Vertical gardening

If your garden lacks sufficient space, you can still utilize this technique to enhance its aesthetic appeal in numerous ways. Growing plants upwards can save a lot of space, and urban areas highly recommend it. You can use this method both indoors and outdoors.

8. Employees’ gardening initiatives

These types of initiatives are vibrant hubs of collaboration, education, and sustainability. It is important to raise awareness about these initiatives and ensure their protection. These venues serve as perfect places for educational outreach, offering workshops and events that help participants from all age groups expand their gardening skills and environmental awareness.

9. Energy- and resource-efficient equipment

Ensure the energy efficiency of your garden by utilizing solar power and eco-conscious products. Switching to an energy-efficient version can save a lot of money.

10. Waste reduction and recycling

There are specific ways to manage waste in a commercial landscape. Conduct recycling programs to get rid of waste materials that can’t be reused or composted and if a plastic pot is not usable anymore send it to recycling. Also, reuse clay reusable plastic, or any reusable materials from your garden to reduce the waste.
